# 🎙️ Dual Cast Commentary System

AI-powered real-time dual-caster commentary for Valorant matches — built for Code for Bharat Season 2.

## 🚀 Overview

The Dual Cast Commentary System brings the thrill of professional shoutcasting to casual and community Valorant games. Using AI, text-to-speech (TTS), and game event detection, the system generates **real-time dual voice commentary** — one analytical and one hype — for three phases of the game:
- 🧠 **Agent Selection Phase**
- 💰 **Buy Phase**
- 🔥 **Game Phase**

No casters? No problem.

## 🧠 Architecture & Workflow

1. **🎞️ Frame Processor (Main Script)**  
   - Processes incoming video stream.
   - Extracts 1 frame per second and sends it to the **Phase Classifier**.

2. **📊 Phase Classifier**  
   - Classifies the current frame into one of the three phases:
     - **Agent Selection**
     - **Buy Phase**
     - **Game Phase**

3. **🧠 Phase-Specific Model Pipelines**
   - Based on the phase, frames are routed to dedicated model stacks:
     - 🔹 **Agent Phase** → `ResNet-50`
     - 🔹 **Buy Phase** → `YOLOv8 + ResNet-18`
     - 🔹 **Game Phase** → `YOLOv8 + ResNet-18`

4. **🔄 Back to Main Script**
   - Outputs (agents, weapons, spike status, etc.) are returned to the main script.
   - Triggers commentary templates and sends to TTS engine.

5. **🗣️ Dual-Caster Commentary Engine**
   - Two unique TTS voices simulate professional casters.
   - One delivers **hype**, the other provides **analysis**.
   - Voices alternate naturally with contextual awareness.

## 💡 Key Features

- 🎭 **Dual TTS Voices**: One hype, one analytical — like real shoutcasters.
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Reactions**: Commentary matches the game flow with low latency.
- 🧩 **Modular Templates**: Custom JSON/CSV commentary lines for all match events.
- 🤖 **Smart Phase Detection**: Uses a custom classifier to detect game phases.
- 🧠 **Agent & Event Recognition**: Leverages ResNet and YOLOv8 to detect agent locks, spike, clutches, aces, buys, and more.
- 🎮 **Valorant-Specific Logic**: Built entirely around Valorant game mechanics.
- 📦 **Plug-and-Play UI (optional)**: Simple Flask or Streamlit front-end for demo/testing.

### 📦 Folder Structure
- `main.py` — Central orchestrator, routes frames and commentary.
- `phase_classifier/` — Detects current phase (Agent, Buy, Game).
- `agent_phase/` — ResNet-50 for locked agent recognition.
- `buy_phase/` — YOLOv8 + ResNet-18 to detect loadouts and economy.
- `game_phase/` — YOLOv8 + ResNet-18 for spike, kills, etc.
- `tts_engine/` — Generates voice output using dual TTS.
- `commentary_templates/` — Phase-wise hype + analytical scripts.
- `utils/` — Frame handling and shared helper functions.

## 🧠 Models Used

| Phase           | Models Used            |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Agent Phase     | ResNet-50              |
| Buy Phase       | YOLOv8 + ResNet-18     |
| Game Phase      | YOLOv8 + ResNet-18     |
| Phase Detection | Custom Phase Classifier|
